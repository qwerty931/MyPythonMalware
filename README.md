	<li>PHP script can automatically create folders based on the <strong>unique</strong> '<strong>botId' </strong>created and<strong> </strong>sent by the bot</li>

</li>
	<li><strong>Sends MD5</strong> hash of the file , before uploading the original file so as to check for any bad upload</li>

<h2>How to setup the python malware :</h2>


<p>The main file is the '<strong>Client.py</strong>', which needs to be compiled and run on the victim machine , it has been <strong>tested on my PC</strong> and works out to be fine.</p>
<p>The php files need to be uploaded to any free/paid webhosting services.<br>The <strong>rtc.php</strong> file acts your single medium of communication between the bot and the owner (as of now) . rtc.php saves command received from the owner into '<strong>comm.txt</strong>' which the bot reads as command .After executing the command it then sends data back as <strong>POST / GET</strong> request , where rtc.php stores it as the result of the command , again in comm.txt.</p>
 
 <h3>Current Working</h3>
 <ul>
	<li>Data from the bot is saved in text file , the identification Data</li>
	<li>Screenshots inside the <strong>uploads</strong> folder with the botID as another folder</li>
 </ul>

<h3>ToDo</h3>
 <ul>
 	<li>Spreading capabilities need to be added</li>
	<li>Save data in a database</li>
	<li>Create Admin Panel</li>
 </ul>
